In this work we presented a numerical study of run-up oscillations over a
typical fringing reef profile at laboratory-scale. The non-hydrostatic
[SWASH](http://swash.sourceforge.net/) model was calibrated and validated using
experimental data of free surface elevation for 8 gauges and run-up
oscillations.  The model shows a high sensitivity to variations in the
parameters of bottom friction and horizontal mixing length. A process of
calibration found the optimal values to be and respectively. With these values,
the model is good at reproducing bulk run-up parameters such as the mean run-up
period, sea-swell significant run-up and infragravity significant run-up. The
ratio between the infragravity and sea-swell run-up is highly dependent on the
surf similarity parameter. For dissipative and intermediate conditions, the
run-up is mainly dominated by low frequency or infragravity oscillations,
whereas for reflective conditions high frequency or sea-swell oscillations
become more important.

The results show that the run-up spectrum at high frequencies is proportional to
the frequency power negative four. The energy level at high frequencies is
apparently independent of the offshore wave conditions and the width of the reef
flat.  However, the depth of the reef crest seems to be the most influential
variable on the high-frequency energy. A parametric equation that depends on
both the energy level at high frequency and a function of the run-up period was
obtained to analyze the spectral characteristics of the wave run-up. This
equation can be considered a first approach to a general parameterization of the
run-up spectrum for reef zones, which can be useful in coastal engineering
applications, such as predicting both the run-up height and frequency, spectral
response of sediment transport in the swash zone, and coupling with spectral
wave models.
