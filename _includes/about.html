            I am a physical oceanographer with a primary focus on ocean surface waves and air-sea interactions. My research involves the analysis of in-situ and remote sensing ocean wave data as well as the use of numerical models to better understand wave dynamycs. I am particularly fascinated by the intricate role of ocean waves in energy transfer, momentum exchange, and mass fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at ENS Paris-Saclay, where I am actively investigating the complex behaviour of ocean waves and how they affect weather and climate patterns.
